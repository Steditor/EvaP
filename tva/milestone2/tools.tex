Tools were run on the function \texttt{send\_publish\_notifications(..)} and on the file \texttt{tools.py}.

\paragraph{Pylint}
The Python quality checker \emph{Pylint} is a tool to help with coding standard as recommended by PEP 8, error detection and refactoring.
Pylint message categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (C) convention: programming standard violation
    \item (R) refactor: code smell
    \item (W) warning: python specific problem
    \item (E) error: likely bug
    \item (F) fatal: an error occurred preventing pylint from continuing the analysis
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:pylint}
\end{figure} 
As expected after our testing Pylint found mostly violated coding conventions in \texttt{send\_publish\_notifications(..)} (\ref{fig:pylint}). 
The investigation of the file \texttt{tools.py} leads to a few warnings and refactoring hints that we will discuss with the developers on the next occasion.

\paragraph{PyCharm}

\paragraph{Pychecker}
Even though you still find some outdated recommendations this tool's peak seems to be over. 
The last update was in 2008.
It is written for Python 2.x and has never been ported to Python 3.x.
Since the installation process requires Python 2.x while we work with Python 3.x in EvaP we will drop our investigation with this tool.

\paragraph{pep8}
The Python style guide checker \emph{pep8} checks code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.
It differentiates between errors and warnings.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{graphics/pep8_send_publish_notifications_1}
    \caption{pep8 messages for \texttt{send\_publish\_notifications(..)}}
    \label{fig:pep8}
\end{figure} 
pep8 throws a few more errors about lines being too long, because the line length was set to 100 instead of 80 characters in Pylint.

\paragraph{Pyflakes}
Unlike Pylint and pep8 \emph{Pyflakes} does not check for violations of coding style but instead focuses on checking for errors.
The tool is less intuitively to use as there is no report if no errors are found. 
It did not report any errors for either \texttt{send\_publish\_notifications(..)} or \texttt{tools.py}
