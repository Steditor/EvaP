\section{Conclusion}

During our project we were able to show, that even a software that is under constant use can still include undetected faults.
In our case these faults were of minor relevance, as they did not propagate to full-blown failures.

The tools for testing and static analysis we used helped us to identify faults more easily, but all of them still have room to improve.
Some only provide very limited results, others suffer from complicated setup and configuration procedures, before a tester can gain profit from the inspections.

In our case, the highest goal of the seminar --- to be able to verify certain properties of a part of our software system --- could not be reached, as the technologies used for EvaP currently make it impossible to apply such advanced but complicated techniques.
