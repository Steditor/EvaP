\subsection{Initial Test Plan}

\subsubsection{Five V\&V Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item When do verification and validation start?

	When are they complete?
	\item What particular techniques should be applied during development?
	\item How can we assess the readiness of a product?
	\item How can we control the quality of successive releases?
	\item How can the development process itself be improved?
\end{enumerate}
