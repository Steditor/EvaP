\subsubsection{Selected Control Flow Graph}
We chose the function, because %TODO  

During our research we found two promising tools for control flow graph creation. 
The first tool is hosted open source on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/danielrandall/python-control-flow-graph}). 
Unfortunately, it is not documented and its execution lead to errors. 
After a few tries, we estimated that fixing the tool would take more time than creating the control flow graph by hand.
The second tool found was even more promising as it was a report of a master graduate from the university of Texas titled: 
``Control flow graph visualisation and its application to coverage and fault localization in Python''
by Jackson Lee Salling.
His tool even visualized edge-pair and prime path coverage in control flow graphs.
But unfortunately he did not respond to our request if we could use the tool for our project or if he had tips for published tools.


Therefore, we created the control flow graph by hand. We experienced some difficulties with Python's code style:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{def send\_publish\_notifications(
        grade\_document\_courses=None, 
        evaluation\_results\_courses=None):}
    
    
    \item \texttt{grade\_document\_courses = grade\_document\_courses or []}
    
    This assignment of either the \texttt{grade\_document\_courses} or an empty list is dependent on the evaluation of \texttt{grade\_document\_courses}. Here are several statements hidden in one line.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
