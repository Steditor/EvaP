\subsubsection{Test Automation}
The project is already covered by several tools.
Our research showed the used tools are popular in the Python community if the project is hosted on GitHub.
Because of this and since the developers are comfortable with their choices, we will observe the functionality of the tools during the project.
We will focus this section on describing our experience with the set up of running tests locally.
